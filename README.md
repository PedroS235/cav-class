This repository contains the python files and Jupyter notebooks for the main project of the Connected and Autonomous Vehicle class.

- The notebooks introduce an implementation of the topics taught in class to be completed by the students, as well as questions to test their understanding of their code and the concepts behind it. For each module, the notebook must be finished before starting the Python files.
- The Python files must be completed by the students in order to implement the previously introduced concept within the CARLA simulator.
